## How to install (the simple way)

1.	Check and make sure the following tasks are true for a smooth install

	- [x] *ACF QuickEdit Fields* plugin is **NOT** activated (or make sure it's at version 2.4.19)

	- [x]	*Sidebar Menu ACF Field group* (`'group_5c366a793a9df'`), or any fields or field groups that matches the field keys in this file [ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/fields/fields.php](ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/fields/fields.php) **DO NOT** exist in the back-end


2.	Install this boi
3.	go to *Admin > iLawyer Sidebar Settings > Subdirectory Sidebars* and setup appropriate subdirectory sidebars if needed
4.	go to *Admin > Appearance > Widgets* and setup or migrate contents of blog and default sidebars into the ilawyer setup sidebars
5.	Open index.php or theme template(s) that utilize sidebars in a text editor and remove all `dynamic_sidebar()` declarations and place `bulk_sidebar()` appropriately. Modify template code as needed as well.
6.	Migrate remaining sidebar content the setup. setup subdirectory widgets or custom sidebar menus as needed


## Render sidebar

To generate sidebar call on the function `bulk_sidebar()`

This function calls on a template that goes through all possible sidebars implemented by and through this plugin
	
Example:

Suppose we edit index.php, old code may look like this:

```
<aside>
	<?php if(is_home()){
		dynamic_sidebar('blog_sidebar');
	}else if(is_page(6669)){
		dynamic_sidebar('6669_sidebar');
	}else if(is_page(4)){
		dynamic_sidebar('4_sidebar');
	}else{
		dynamic_sidebar('default_sidebar');
	} ?>
</aside>
```

When the plugin is set up, it will register a widget area for pages, blogs, and custom parent sidebars or custom menus to individual pages with the single function:

```
<aside>
	<?php bulk_sidebar(); ?>
</aside>
```

In case the rendered content needs to be customized, the function calls on a boiler template: [ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/template/sidebar.php](ilaw-nav-field-bulk-edit-support/template/sidebar.php) which can be copied into your theme instead of using the function
